# ü©∫ Health Time Prediction

This repository contains a solution for the **Health Time Prediction** problem on MapnaAI Contest.  
The goal is to predict the remaining healthy time (or useful life) of a system using machine learning techniques.

## üìÇ Project Overview
The workflow in the notebook `notebook.ipynb` includes:
- Importing the dataset from the `Data` folder  
- Preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Training a machine learning model  
- Evaluating the model with defined metrics  
- Predicting on the test dataset  
- Exporting results into a `result.zip` file for submission  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
